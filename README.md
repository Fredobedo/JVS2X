# JVS2X
 This project aim to use Home consoles or PC's in an arcade CAB.
 <BR>JVS2X is the interface between the Arcade IO Board and the host (software HID controller), converting JVS protocol to USB.
 <BR>The host (home console) will detect it as a compatible game controller. 
 <BR>It can also emulates a keyboard (i.e. for Mame projects)
 <BR>
 Please consider this as a development version :)
 <BR> <BR>
 For now on, I use VS Code with PlatformIO IDE extension:
 <BR>   - Board: Teensy 2.0
 <BR>   - Framework: Arduino
