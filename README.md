# JVS2X
 This project aim to use Home consoles or PC's in an arcade CAB.
 <BR>It acts as an interface between the host and the Arcade IO Board, converting JVS protocol to USB (software HID Device).
 <BR>The host (home console/PC) will detect it as a compatible game controller/Keyboard. 
 <BR> <BR>
 Please consider this as a development version :)
 <BR> <BR>
 For now on, I use VS Code with PlatformIO IDE extension:
 <BR>   - Board: Teensy 2.0
 <BR>   - Framework: Arduino
