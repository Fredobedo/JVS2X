# JVS2X
 <h2>Introduction </h2>
 This project aim to use Home consoles or PC's in an arcade CAB.
 <BR>It acts as an interface between the host and the Arcade IO Board, converting JVS protocol to USB (software HID Device).
 <BR>The host (home console/PC) will detect it as a compatible game controller/Keyboard.
